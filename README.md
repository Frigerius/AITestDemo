# AITestDemo
Test Game for different AI techniques (BT/FSM/Utility). This game was used as demonstration for a talk at my university.

This game consists of three different levels, which demonstrate that you can perform nearly the same behavior of an AI with different techniques.
In this case there is an AIs for Behavior Trees, Hierarchical Finite State Machines and a Uitility AI

These videos show what the AIs do:
